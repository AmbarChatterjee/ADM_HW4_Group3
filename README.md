# ADM_HW4_Group3 - Recommendation systems and clustering everywhere

This repository contains code and analysis for the 4th homework assignment for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course. 

## Contents

The repository contains the following key files:

- `main.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing implementation and analysis for the recommendation system and clustering tasks
- `CommandLine.sh`: Bash script to execute command line tasks 
- `SS.png`: Screenshot of command line output
- `vodclickstream_uk_movies_03.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used

## Usage

The main tasks are implemented in `main.ipynb`. This covers:

- Recommendation system using minhash and LSH
- User clustering with feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, K-means and DBSCAN
- The command line question and the algorithmic question

The command line question is executed via `CommandLine.sh` and output is shown in `SS.png`.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3 and standard data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, etc. 

The bash script assumes a Linux/Unix environment with common command line utilities like grep, wc, etc.
