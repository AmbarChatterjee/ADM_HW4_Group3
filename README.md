# ADM_HW4_Group3

This repository contains code and analysis for the 4th homework assignment for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course. 

## Contents

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- `CLQ_AQ/`: Directory containing code and output for the command line question (CLQ) and algorithmic question (AQ)
  - `CLQ_AQ.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the CLQ and AQ
  - `CommandLine.sh`: Bash script to execute command line tasks 
  - `SS.png`: Screenshot of command line output
  - `vodclickstream_uk_movies_03.zip`: Zip file containing the dataset
- `HW4_main.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing implementation and analysis for the recommendation system and clustering tasks
- `hw4_ex2.ipynb`: Additional Jupyter notebook related to the clustering exercise
- `vodclickstream_uk_movies_03.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used

## Usage

The main tasks are implemented in `HW4_main.ipynb`. This covers:

- Recommendation system using minhash and LSH
- User clustering with feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and K-means

The command line question is executed via `CommandLine.sh` and output is shown in `SS.png`.

The algorithmic question is implemented in `CLQ_AQ.ipynb`.

Additional clustering analysis is in `hw4_ex2.ipynb`.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3 and standard data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, etc. 

The bash script assumes a Linux/Unix environment with common command line utilities like grep, wc, etc.
